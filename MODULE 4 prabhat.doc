\fs36 1. What is Network?\par
ANS: \lang1033 Group of connected computers called network\b0\fs22 .\par
\b\fs36 A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications. The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams\cf4\lang9\par
\cf0 2. What is Internet & Intranet?\par
Ans: the internet is a global computer network that allows for information exchange between devices. An intranet is a private network that is only accessible to members of an organization. An intranet is internal and only accessible to members of an organization.\par

\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1 How many types of Network we used?\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li360\sa200\sl276\slmult1 Ans: mainly there are three types of networks: LAN (local area network), WAN (wide area network), and WAN (metropolitan area network). LAN is used to connect devices in a small area like building, office, etc. MAN covers the devices connected within a town or a city.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1 2.\tab Different between LAN & PAN?\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li360\sa200\sl276\slmult1 Ans: LAN stands for local area network. PAN stands for personal area network. The major difference between these networks is that a PAN connects the devices within the sort range of an individual person, whereas a LAN connects devices at a single site, typically an office building.  \par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li360\sa200\sl276\slmult1 Ans: LAN stands for local area network.\b0\fs22\lang1033  \b\fs36 This is one of the original categories of network, and one of the simplest. LAN networks connect computers together over relatively small distances, such as within a single building or within a small group of buildings. Homes often have LAN networks too, especially if there is more than one device in the home. Often they do not contain more than one subnet, if any, and are usually controlled by a single administrator. They do not have to be connected to the internet to work, although they can be.\lang9\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li360\sa200\sl276\slmult1 Ans: network configuration is the process of assigning network settings, policies, flows, and controls. In a virtual network, it\rquote s easier to make network configuration changes because physical network devices appliances are replaced by software, removing the need for extensive manual configuration.\par

\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1 What is the difference between WEP and WPA?\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li360\sa200\sl276\slmult1 Ans: while WEP provides each authorized system with the same key, WPA uses the temporal key integrity protocol (TKIP), which dynamically changes the key that systems use.\par
WEP stands for wired equivalent privacy, and WPA stands for wireless protected access. WPA2 is the second version of the WPA standard. Using some encryption is always better than using none, but WEP is the lest secure of these standards, and you should not use it if you can avoid it. \par
